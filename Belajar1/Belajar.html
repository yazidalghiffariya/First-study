        I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
        I want you back, I want you back
        My neighbors think I'm crazy, but they don't understand
        You're all I had, you're all I had
        <br>
        At night, when the stars light up my room
        I sit by myself
        <br>
        Talking to the moon
        Tryna get to you
        In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
        Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
        Oh
        <br>
        I'm feelin' like I'm famous, the talk of the town
        They say I've gone mad, yeah, I've gone mad
        But they don't know what I know, 'cause when the sun goes down
        Someone's talking back, yeah, they're talking back, oh
        <br>
        At night, when the stars light up my room
        I sit by myself
        <br>
        Talking to the moon
        Tryna get to you
        In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
        Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
        <br>
        Ah, ah, ah
        Do you ever hear me calling?
        (Ah) oh-oh-oh (ah), oh-oh-oh (ah)
        <br>
        'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
        Still tryna get to you
        In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
        Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
        Oh
        <br>
        I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
